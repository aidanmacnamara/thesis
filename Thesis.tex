\emph{Aim}

The aim of this work was to investigate what constitutes a protective cellular immune response to HTLV-I infection, focusing on understanding the relationship between HLA class I and the outcome of infection. Initially, we conducted an analysis of our patient cohort to identify robust associations between HLA class I type and infection outcome. We then identified and optimized the most accurate epitope prediction software and applied these techniques to identify the constituents of a protective HLA class I restricted response. In related projects, we identified viral factors that impact on the efficiency of the CD8$^+$ T cell response and also investigated the role of KIR:HLA genotype in the outcome of HTLV-I infection.

%The aim of this work was to investigate what constitutes a protective cellular immune response to HTLV-I infection, with a particular focus on understanding the relationship between HLA class I and the outcome of infection. Examining the CD8$^+$ T cell response to HTLV-I, we conducted a rigorous analysis of our patient cohort to identify robust associations between HLA class I type and the outcome of infection (proviral load or disease status). We then identified and optimised the most accurate epitope prediction software and applied these techniques to analyse our patient database, in order to identify the constituents of a protective HLA class I restricted response. These predictions were then then verified and tested experimentally in collaboration. In related projects, we identified viral factors that impact on the efficiency of the CD8$^+$ T cell response and also investigated the role of KIR:HLA genotype in the outcome of HTLV-I infection.

\emph{Results}

We produced a more accurate method of epitope prediction that we call Metaserver. This method was used to predict HTLV-I epitopes that bind to the HLA class I alleles of our patient cohort. We then developed a statistical method that demonstrated targeting the HTLV-I protein HBZ is beneficial in terms of disease status and proviral load. In the related analysis of the CD8$^+$ T cell response to HTLV-I infected cells, we produced a model measuring the lysis of infected cells as a function of antigen expression and showed a positive relationship between antigen expression and lysis efficiency. For our analysis of KIR genotype, we found no relationship between KIR:HLA interactions and disease status or proviral load in HTLV-I infection.

%Following a stringent analysis of currently available epitope prediction software, we produced a more accurate method of epitope prediction that we call Metaserver. This method was used to predict HTLV-I epitopes that bind to the HLA class I alleles of our patient cohort. We then developed a novel statistical method that demonstrated targeting the HTLV-I protein HBZ is beneficial in terms of disease status and proviral load. In the related analysis of the CD8$^+$ T cell response to HTLV-I infected cells, we produced a model measuring the lysis of infected cells as a function of antigen expression and showed a positive relationship between antigen expression and lysis efficiency. Finally, for our analysis of KIR genotype, we found no relationship between KIR:HLA interactions and disease status or proviral load in HTLV-I infection.

\emph{Conclusion}

We conclude that CD8$^+$ T cells play a central role in the control of HTLV-I and that CD8$^+$ cells specific to HBZ, not the immunodominant protein Tax, are the most effective. We suggest that HBZ plays a central role in HTLV-I persistence. The statistical method we used to quantify the specificity of HLA class I binding to viral epitopes is applicable across all pathogens, even where data are sparse.

We suggest that HBZ plays a central role in HTLV-I persistence. The statistical method we used to quantify the specificity of HLA class I binding to viral epitopes is applicable across all pathogens, even where data are sparse. We also found that antigen density was a determinant of CD8$^+$ lysis efficiency. Finally, we found no evidence that NK cells play a major role in determining the outcome to HTLV-I infection.
 
%showed that previously defined beneficial alleles (A*02 and Cw*08) strongly bind to epitopes from the HTLV-I protein HBZ, compared to the defined detrimental allele (B*54). We also showed that asymptomatic carriers possess HLA class I alleles that bind to HBZ epitopes more strongly than HAM/TSP individuals' HLA class I repertoire.

%Using a patient cohort of 432 HTLV-I infected individuals, 202 asymptomatic and 232 showing symptoms of disease, we initially conducted a rigorous analysis to identify robust associations betweem HLA class I type and the outcome of infection. We then identified and optimised the most accurate epitope prediction software available to test hypotheses about HLA class I type and the HTLV-I viral epitopes that they present to the host CD8$^+$ population. Finally the predictions of this work were tested in collaboration with experimentalists.

I would like to thank my supervisor, Becca Asquith, for her advice, time, support and encouragement throughout my PhD and for producing a great environment for learning. I would also like to thank Charles Bangham for his help and support and his infectious enthusiasm for HTLV-I research and science in general.

Many thanks to Ulrich Kadolsky. As a computational biologist, with the emphasis on biology, I was fortunate to be sitting next to a real computer scientist, or else everything would have taken a good deal longer. I would also like to thank my collaborators within the Department of Immunology, namely Tarek Kattan and Aileen Rowan. It was very enjoyable working together to produce research that combined experimental and theoeretical approaches. I would also like to thank Graham Taylor and Silva Hilburn for their help with my research and everyone in the department for their general help and support.

I am grateful to the Wellcome Trust for funding this work.

Finally, I would like to thank Jaydee, Noah and my family for their patience with all those hours spent in front of the computer!
